## How to resume development:

- Ensure all files from this package are downloaded
- Ensure you have at least Python 3.97 and Node.JS installed. After these both are down, follow the below instructions
    1. Navigate to the *pricetracker* directory, and type `python -m pip install pipenv` into your terminal of choice. This will create a virtual environment for this project.
    2. Follow by typing `pipenv shell` and `pipenv install`. This launches you into the virtual environment and installs the necessary packages.
    3. I'll have to put here specific install instructions for React cuz I forgot lol
